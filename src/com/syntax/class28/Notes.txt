What is a List:
    List is an interface inside the collections' framework Which have below properties
    1) Insertion order is maintained.
    2) I can Store duplicate data.
List is implemented by many classes but we will be focusing on ArrayList and LinkedList:
ArrayList:
    when my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then i should be going
    with ArrayList.
LinkedList:
    Most of our operations will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start or shifting the
    data we should be going with LinkedList.
Iterator:
    is an interface that has three methods hasNext() next() and remove().
    whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop there are chances that it will
    not work or will throw an error because lists are dynamic and can change the size at runtime
    so to be always on the safe side we should use Iterators.
