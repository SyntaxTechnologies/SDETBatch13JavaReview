Types of variables in java:
    We have three types of variables 1) local 2)instance 3)static.
Local variables:
    Are the variables that we declared inside a block of code
    upSide:They occupy the memory for shortest period of time
    downSide: They can't be accessed outside that block in which they are declared.
Instance Variables:
    Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside a block of code.
    upSIde: Can be accessed in all the methods of class. They can have different values for each
    instance of that class.

Static variable
    All the variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword they are
    called static variables.
    upSide:
    1) They only reserve a single memory location for all the instances of a class
    2) They can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name
