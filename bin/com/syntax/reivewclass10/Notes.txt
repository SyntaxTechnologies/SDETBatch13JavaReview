Method Overriding:
    When same method exists in parent and child class.
Why we should use method overriding.
     Same method can behave differently on different objects. It allows us to achieve polymorphism.
What is the syntax to achieve method overriding:
    Redefine the method with same header inside the child class.
class Parent{

void sleep(){
sout"i sleep 8 hours"
}
}
class Child extends Parent{

void sleep(){
sout"i sleep 6 hours"

}


public static void main(String[] args){

Parent parent=new Child();  //polymorphism
parent.sleep();
}
}

Rules:
    1)There should inheritance between classes.
    2) Method header should be same(access modifiers return type method name parameters).
    3) we can't override the private methods because private methods don't participate in
    inheritance.
    4) Constructors can't be overridden because they also don't participate in inheritance.
    5) we can only increase the visibility of a method inside the child class, but we
     can't decrease it for example if a method is declared protected or default we can change
     it to public, but we can't do the reverse.
     6) We don't say we override the static methods we say we have declared the static methods.
     7) Methods that are declared with the final keyword can't be overridden.
