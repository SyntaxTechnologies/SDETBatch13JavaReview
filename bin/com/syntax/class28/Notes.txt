What is a List:
    List is an interface inside the collections' framework Which have below properties
    1) Insertion order is maintained.
    2) I can Store duplicate data.
List is implemented by many classes but we will be focusing on ArrayList and LinkedList:
ArrayList:
    when my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then i should be going
    with ArrayList.
LinkedList:
    Most of our operations will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start or shifting the
    data we should be going with LinkedList.
